The Candy Dispenser app is a python project built using the CustomTkinter GUI library.
It applies and visualizes the stack data structure, showing the Last-in-First-Out working principle the fundamental operations of pushing and popping.
Candy is added at the top of the dispenser and the spring below compresses correspondingly. Candy is popped out at the top too, with the spring below relaxing accordingly.
